                                        <strong>Google Ads</strong> is an ad delivery service provided by Google that
                                        can
                                        deliver ads to
                                        users. In particular, Google allows us to tailor the ads in a way that they will
                                        appear, for example, only to users that have conducted certain actions with our
                                        App
                                        (for example, show our ads to users who have not purchased a subscription).

                                        of ads on Snapchat in case you use our App. Snapchat allows you to <a
